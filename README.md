# QR Code Windshield CNN (Patch Classification)

## Structure
- data/raw: original images
- data/patches: 265x265 patches (train/val/test + qr/no_qr)
- src/: code (preprocessing, training, inference)
- models/: saved models
- runs/: logs, metrics, checkpoints

## Next steps
- scripts to generate patches
- training script (baseline CNN)
